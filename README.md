# Crop-Craft
Crop Craft is an IoT-powered smart irrigation solution designed to enhance agricultural efficiency through intelligent moisture monitoring and control. At its core, the system utilizes a soil moisture sensor to assess real-time soil conditions, enabling precise water management. A NodeMCU microcontroller, connected via Wi-Fi, serves as the central hubâ€”receiving moisture data and transmitting it to a cloud platform for analysis and visualization.

Through a user-friendly mobile or web interface, farmers can monitor soil status remotely, configure target moisture thresholds, and control the water pump via a dual-channel relay. An onboard LCD screen also displays live readings of moisture levels and irrigation status for local monitoring.

Tested within a controlled greenhouse setup, Crop Craft consistently maintained optimal soil moisture with over 90% accuracy, showcasing its potential in improving water usage, crop health, and overall agricultural sustainability. The framework allows scalability and can be upgraded with additional environmental sensors like temperature and humidity to support more comprehensive climate-aware farming.

Built during a 36-hour sprint at the REVA University SMART AGRO HACKATHON (Nov 2023), Crop Craft led our team to victory by demonstrating real-world impact, technical innovation, and scalability in precision farming [See the winning moment](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7136759213950734336/).
